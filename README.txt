<----------------------Project Progress--------------------------------->

Instead of going for particle shapes I decided that slightly simpler
alpha based quads that were textured looked better. The particles have
color and alpha that changes over time.

My plans are to create and finish a house, as well as add ways for the user
to modify the particles in whatever way they choose.
